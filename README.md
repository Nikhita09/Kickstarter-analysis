CONCLUSIONS:

* Looking at "Outcomes based on Goals”, chances of success increases as the goal amount increases till 30000, however the absence of a pattern after 30000 indicate that chance of success does not depend on goal amount alone for the category “theater”.
* We can also note that no fundraiser for “theater” was ever canceled which is a positive sign. 
* “Outcomes based on Launch date” indicate May, June and July are the most successful months to start a campaign for the category “theater”. Number of fundraisers for “theater” category significantly increased after 2013.
* Based on the Outcomes vs. Avg length of fundraiser we can also conclude that the length of the fundraiser has no impact on the outcome of the campaign.
* Based on category, Music (77%) Theater (60%) and Film&Video (58%) are the most successful categories across all countries. While Journalism (0%) and Food (17%) were least successful.
* GB had the most successful fundraisers (71% success) for the category “theater”. US had the highest number of “theater” fundraisers throughout the years with 57% being successful. GB shows an average amount of approx. $2000 being raised for “theater” and US shows an average amount of approx. $5000 being raised for “theater”.

LIMITATIONS/SUGGESTIONS:

* Data does not capture how the fundraiser campaigns are being marketed (throughs ads, online, emails, social media etc.) which will give us an insight on how to target the people who are pledging money and also understand most popular methods to reach out to most number of people.
* Data does not capture demographics of the people pledging money which would help us if categorize certain groups would be more interested in a particular category (like theatre, Film&Video, Music etc) more than others.
* Suggestions would include:
  * Looking at country-wise breakdown of the data to see which category is most popular for each country
  * Looking at average amounts pledged for each category to get an idea of how much to set at a target goal amount for your next fundraiser.
